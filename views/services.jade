                                The Preschool program is designed for the two and three year old children that are potty-trained.  In this group the children will practice their small motor skills, i.e.  cutting with scissors, coloring, gluing, blocks and puzzles.  They will practice socialization skills and verbalization through games, music, story-time and small group discussions.  There will be several opportunities on a daily basis for dramatic play, dress-up and free-play, as well as exercise for the development of large motor muscles.

                            p.
                                The Pre-Kindergarten program is designed for older four and five year olds that have missed the Kindergarten deadline.  In our Pre-Kindergarten, the children begin working on a reading program.  This program consists of printing, work sheets and letter puppets.  The art projects in this group will be slightly more complicated than the preschool group.  Children, by now, should be easily able to manipulate scissors and pencils.  Rules are introduced to this age group because the children are more ready to understand and follow a structured environment.  One of the major goals of this program is to increase the childrenâ€™s attention span in a fun way so they will expend more time and effort on each and every project introduced to them.  Letter and number recognition and beginning letter sounds of words is also a goal to be accomplished by the years end.

This program offers children leaving for or coming from an all day school program, time to rest, time to play, time to do arts and crafts, musical experiences, computer learning and homework help.  Children can attend either before or after school sessions, or both before and after school sessions.
