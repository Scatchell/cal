                                            months but only left because we relocated. He quickly made an impact with all the
                                            teachers. And we saw great improvement to his playing and learning at home. We have
                                            now set Care-A-Lot as our comparison to find a new daycare out of state, and have
                                            not been fully satisfied. The daily feedback sheets, art projects, and outdoor time
                                            were very appreciated and have yet to be found again. Your child will be in great
                                            hands at Care-A-Lot."

                                            with them and help them use their imagination. I also plan on enrolling my 7 year

                                            "My daughter has been attending Care A Lot on Milwaukee since she was 16 months old.
                                             When I went to check out the school I saw a mom outside about to drop off their
                                             child and I asked her what she thought of the school and she raved about how great
                                             it was and how much their child has learned. Instantly, my daughter was drawn to
                                             the friendly environment and did not want to leave when we were done with our
                                             tour. My daughter is now turning 4 and I could not be happier with her teachers
                                             and the genuine care she has had for the past 2.5 years. She is excited about
                                             going to school and has learned so much more then I ever could have expected.
                                             It is a huge comfort to know that she is in such good hands while I am at work.
                                             I highly recommend this preschool."

                                            importantly they have reemphasized what we teach my son at home which is to be nice
