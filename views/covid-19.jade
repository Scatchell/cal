                            p In these difficult times, we realize parents may appreciate their children getting the chance to talk to the teachers they know and love from Care-A-Lot. In order to do our best to continue giving a great experience to the kids who can no longer attend day care during this lockdown period, we've made an effort to set up a video chat where some of our teachers can continue to interact with the students. If you would like to be included in this program, free of cost, please contact us over E-Mail!
