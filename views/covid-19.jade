                                Care-A-Lot has been closed since march 23 due to the covid-19 virus. We are watching the news to see when Governor Pritzker deems it safe enough to re-open daycare centers in the city of Chicago.
                            p.
                                As soon as we hear that it is safe, Care-A-Lot will open once again. We will phone all the families enrolled at the center to advise them of our opening date as soon as we know.
                            p.
                                We thank you for your patience and understanding during the shutdown. We hope that you are all enjoying this extra time with your children. They are delightful treasures that will flourish with this extra family time!
                            p.
                                Please stay safe and healthy - we miss you all and can't wait to welcome you back to Care-A-Lot!

                            p In these difficult times, we realize parents may appreciate their children getting the chance to talk to the teachers they know and love from Care-A-Lot. In order to do our best to continue giving a great experience to the kids who can no longer attend day care during this lockdown period, we've made an effort to set up a video chat where some of our teachers can continue to interact with the students. If you would like to be included in this program, free of cost, please contact us over E-Mail!

                                We were delighted to see some of our students who were walking by respond by sending us the following image
