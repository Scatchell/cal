                        div.collapsible-body
                            p Each classroom has a separate curriculum that fits the age group of that class. Pre reading and reading activities can be found in each classroom, and they are geared up or down according to capabilities. Numbers, science, music, creative art, dramatic play, sensory education, large and small motor skills and language arts are all an intrinsic part of each classroom. Each and every activity is offered in a way to ensure children experience success in the activity. This success will help children develop a strong and healthy self-concept. Please read our Educational Model for further info.
